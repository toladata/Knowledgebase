# Design a Form
---

Data collection forms can be created directly on the TolaData platform.

The form field types that you can use are the following:

| Field type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| number | Number input |
| text | Free text response |
| email | Email input |
| url | Webpage URL or link input |
| date | Date input |
| dropdown | Multiple choice question; multiple answers can be selected |
| cascading dropdown | Sequence of dependent multiple choice question; multiple answers can be selected for each |

#### Build your form


#### Create a template

If you're going to use a similar form repeatedly across programs or projects, you might consider building a template. Create it once and simply `Clone`, rename and reuse every time you need to.
