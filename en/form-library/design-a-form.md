# Design a Form
---

Data collection forms can be created directly on the TolaData platform or integrated from other data collection tools directly to Track. Read more about how to do it in [Import Datasets](https://help.toladata.com/en/track/import-datasets.html) article on the Knowledge Base.

The form field types that you can use on TolaData are:

| Field type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| number | Number input |
| text | Free text response |
| email | Email input |
| url | Webpage URL or link input |
| date | Date input |
| dropdown | Multiple choice question; multiple answers can be selected |
| cascading dropdown | Sequence of dependent multiple choice question; multiple answers can be selected for each |

#### Build your form

Select `Form Library` on the Navigation Bar and hit the orange `+` button.

Then `Add Field` to add questions to your form. You will be able to use validation rules or set up skip logic to make it easier for your enumerators to collect data and best ensure data quality.

> **Quick Tip:** Remember! You won't be able to change a form that has been already used for data collection.

#### Create a template

If you're going to use a similar form repeatedly across programs or projects, you might consider building a template. Create it once and simply `Clone`, rename and reuse every time you need to.
