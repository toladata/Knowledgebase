# Publish a Form
---

Publish your form to start collecting data with it. Keep it Private to be the only user with access, or make it public to allow other users from your organization to access and submit data through your form.

This is an example of a published form.

Click on:
`View Data Table` to access collected data in Track;
`Stop submissions` to prevent team members and enumerators from collecting more data through this form;
`Clone` to copy this form, possibly edit and reuse it for another program;
`Edit` to make changes to your form;
`Make private` to prevent others from seeing and collecting data through your form. 

> **Quick Tip:** Remember! You need to link your form to a program to be able to publish it and use for data collection.

No project has been associated, no `Publish` button is available.
