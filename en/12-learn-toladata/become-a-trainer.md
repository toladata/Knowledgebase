# Best practices

---
In this section you'll find a selection of software training best practices based on our experience. Feel inspired!

#### Get real
1. Base training on individual roles and real life use scenarios. Teach only what they need to know and provide additional resources (like Knowledgebase link) for the curious;
2. Put the new tool in a broader context. Link TolaData to existing business processes and organization needs;
3. Use natural language instead of subject matter jargon;
4. Make the learning environment resemble the work environment. Training should be hands-on, based on real life examples and tasks, practical.

#### Customize
5. Assess the needs, skills and actively seek feedback from your trainees to adjust the training accordingly;
6. Identify agents of change among students, who will help to implement TolaData after the training;
7. Make it short and sweet, don’t take too much of your participants’ time;
8. Cater to additional requests and needs. You don't have to make everything happen, though, but make sure no question remains unanswered.

#### Engage
9. The more you engage your trainees in the training design process, the more successful it will be;
10. Engage the learners during the training by asking questions and using active training methods and let them practice; 
11. People learn best when they are allowed space to make and correct their own mistakes. Use our demo site;
12. Make it collaborative - provide space for peer feedback, questions and discussions as it raises user engagement;
13. Continuously ask for feedback from users and use it to improve your sessions.

#### Be agile
14. Start small - train one team or department, use the system for one program or project, evaluate and only then move on to training the whole organization.

#### Be open & inclusive
15. Keep all materials accessible and in compliance with [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/);
16. Keep the training gender responsive (use gender sensitive language), as you want to train all your team members equally.
