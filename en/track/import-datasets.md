# Import your Datasets
---

Importing is as easy as connecting your Ona account or importing a spreadsheet. When you choose 'Import Data' you have several possibilities to do so. Either you import your data with the universal [format of CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) [redirects to an external website], GoogleSheet, directly from Ona or if you have access to a JSON feed for your data service you can import that too. 
> **Quick Tip:** Data in Excel can be saved as a CSV file format and then imported to Track.

#### **Import CSV**
After selecting `Import from CSV`, fill out the fields and follow onscreen instructions. As a result you should get a data table in Track.

> **Quick Tip:**   
> To better enable the data in your dataset to be analyzed and visualized, it is necessary to make sure your dataset layout is correct. Otherwise you might not be able to import your data to Track. 
>1. **Only one row of column headers for the dataset, with no multi-level or merged cells.** In places where you have been using a two-level column header, you will need to combine the info in the top level and bottom level for each column.
>2. There should be **no blank rows above your data - data should start in cell A1** of the spreadsheet. This is to facilitate the importation of your data into analysis and dashboarding software.
>3. **No merged cells** anywhere ** in your dataset.**
>4. **Notes, comments, associated graphics **or** images belong in a separate read-me file,** and out of the dataset itself.

#### Import from Ona

The first time you want to import from Ona, you will be prompted to login to Ona. Then you will see a list of all your Ona tables displayed. Select an existing data table from Track to pull your data into or enter a name for your new data table.

#### Import GoogleSheets

You will need to first authorize Track and TolaData to access your Google Drive. Then select an existing data table to pull your data into or create a new one.

#### Import JSON feed

Some service providers, like [KoBoToolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) [redirects to an external website], may support access to a JSON feed to your data collected. If so, you can import your data from that provider by choosing JSON from the import menu. Make sure you remember your credentials, should your data be protected by password.
