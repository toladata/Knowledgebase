### Core Products

**Activity** is TolaData’s project management toolkit, comprises a collection of data forms, reports and visualizations designed to track results of your programs and projects.

### ![](/assets_en/Activity_Logo.jpg) Standardization alongside adaptability 
A standard set of forms is available to capture the full data lifecycle of a program, integrating tools like logframe and work-breakdown structures. Each stage of a project is tracked on **Activity** dashboards, allowing managers and staff to see progress at a glance. Primary forms are supplemented by flexible monitoring forms like training attendance or beneficiary registration.

### ![](/assets_en/Activity_Logo.jpg) Transparency through traceable results
The `Indicator` tracking tool creates indicators at activity, output, outcome, and goal level for each program. Progress against each indicator is documented through data sets from digital data collection tools or a consolidator like  **Track**. Hence, the system provides the ability to trace evidence-base, view targets vs. actuals, and analyze cost-benefit/value for money.

### ![](/assets_en/Activity_Logo.jpg) Modular approach to management
Each program activity can be linked to a multitude of connecting modules including budget management, procurement, staffing, stakeholder management, and geo-location tracking. This allows for data linking and reporting across different regions, programs, and activities.

###![](/assets_en/Track_Logo.jpg) Digital data collection 
Developed in-house, our digital data collection application has an integrated form builder and option for QR reader to upload paper forms.  A standardized form library, as well as a custom form builder, ensures that the exact data collection tool is available for every project.

###![](/assets_en/Track_Logo.jpg) Data analysis 
Track can integrate data from multiple platforms and provide merge/append, auto-export, data cleaning, editing, sharing and analysis features. This allows users to collate multiple data silos into one while maintaining the data stream.

###![](/assets_en/Track_Logo.jpg) Data integration 
**Track** directly integrates with mobile data collection platforms such as Ona or KoBoToolbox to provide users with access to all of their forms and data for import and management.  Data can be easily exported to other data platforms or tools, into Google Sheets or downloaded as any number of file types including CSV or XLS.
