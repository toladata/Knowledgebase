### Activity

Activity is TolaData’s project management toolkit, which comprises of a collection of data forms, reports and visualizations designed to track results of your programs and projects.

#### ![](/assets_en/Activity_Logo.jpg) Standardization alongside adaptability
A standard set of forms is available to capture the full data lifecycle of a program, integrating tools like log frame and work-breakdown structures. Each stage of a project is tracked on **Activity** dashboards, allowing managers and staff to see progress at a glance. Primary forms are supplemented by flexible monitoring forms like training attendance or beneficiary registration.

#### ![](/assets_en/Activity_Logo.jpg) Transparency through traceable results
The Indicator tracking tool creates indicators at activity, output, outcome, and goal level for each program. Progress against each indicator is documented through data sets from digital data collection tools or a consolidator like **Track**. Hence, the system provides the ability to trace evidence-base, view targets vs. actuals, and analyze cost-benefit/value for money.

Each program activity can be linked to a multitude of connecting modules including budget management, procurement, staffing, stakeholder management, and geo-location tracking. This allows for data linking and reporting across different regions, programs, and activities.
