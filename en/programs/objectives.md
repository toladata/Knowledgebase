#### What is an objective?

Objectives are specific circumstances to be achieved within a stated time frame that meet a particular goal. Unlike goals, objectives must be measurable to determine progress.

#### Why is it important?

Objectives are necessary to better define the end goal of the program. This helps in measuring and ensuring that the meaningful impact the program intended to accomplish is achieved.

#### Adding objectives
To add objectives:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Objectives` section.
2. Under Strategic Objectives, Click, `Add`.
3. Add your objective Name and Description.
4. After you associate indicators to your objectives, you will see them displayed here.

> **Quick Tip:** 
As part of the program setup it is helpful to add objectives in the system early on. Objectives can typically be found in your program proposal or your Logframe.
