#### Who is a stakeholder?

A stakeholder defines who the program is working with. Stakeholders are people or organizations whether in the public, private or civil sector, whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by a Project Team's decisions, actions, and ensuing results. Examples of stakeholders can be local government offices, institutes, local NGOs, private sector partners etc.

#### Why capture stakeholder information?

* It is a minimum standard and best practice per Program management for development professionals ([PMDPro](http://www.pm4ngos.com/pmd-pro-guide/)) [redirects to an external website] for each program to maintain a Stakeholder Register.

* Provides increased coordination across multiple programs.

* Documents your work with a stakeholder over time for better tracking your relationship.

* Helps you to keep track of your stakeholder status and maintain work history log in case of staff transition, as it provides easy access to information on last contact with a stakeholder. 

#### Adding Stakeholders

TolaData provides the option to capture the following information on relevant program stakeholders:

* Stakeholder Type;

* Contact Details;

* Supporting documentation: Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), due diligence, etc.

To add stakeholders:

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Stakeholder` section.
2. Click, `Add Stakeholder`.
3. Add your stakeholder Name (required). Additionally, you can complete the Sectors, Role, Type, and Country fields.

> **Quick Tip:**
> 1. If your program maintains an existing **stakeholder registry**, the stakeholder section is where this data can be mapped to. 
2. Link your stakeholder to multiple programs and sites to avoid duplication of information.
