**4. Erasure (“right to be forgotten”)**

The user has the right to have us delete any personal data concerning him/her that we store. For this purpose the user can contact datasecurity@toladata.com.

Immediate deletion shall be effected in the following cases:

_Personal data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed;_

_The data subject revokes his or her consent on which the processing was based and there is no other legal basis for processing;_

_The data subject objects to the processing operation and there are no overriding legitimate reasons for the processing operation;_

_The personal data was processed illegally;_

_Deletion of personal data is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation under the law of the European Union or the law of the Member States to which the data controller is subject;_

_The personal data have been collected in relation to information society services directly from a child under the age of sixteen, or rather without consent of the parental responsibility._

In the event of termination of the user relationship, the user’s data will be regularly deleted from the internal database. Data shall be excluded from deletion if, for example, processing of data is necessary for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims; e.g., performance of the contract with us or if there are legal retention periods that prevent deletion.

In the case of non-automated data processing, deletion is also not necessary if this would not be possible due to the special type of storage or would only be possible at disproportionately high expense and the interest of the Employee in the deletion is to be regarded as minimal. The deletion is then replaced by the restriction of processing.

Furthermore, we carry out a restriction of the processing and no deletion of the data, as long as and insofar as we have the reason to assume that a deletion would impair your interests worthy of protection or those of the person affected. In so doing, we will inform you or the affected person of the restriction on processing, provided that such information does not prove to be impossible or would require a disproportionate effort.

**5. Restriction of processing**

You also have the right to demand that the processing be restricted. For this purpose you can contact datasecurity@toladata.com

You can only successfully enforce the right to restrict processing if one of the following prerequisites is met: (ii) processing is unlawful and the data subject refuses to allow the deletion of the personal data and instead requires a restriction on the use of the personal data; (iii) the data controller no longer needs the personal data for the purpose of processing, but the data subject needs it for the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims; or (iv) the data subject has lodged an objection to the processing until it has been established whether the legitimate grounds of the data controller outweigh those of the data subject.

In the event that you have obtained a restriction on processing, we will inform you accordingly before the restriction is lifted.

In certain cases, the processing may also be restricted instead of the data being deleted. See also in particular the previous point “Deletion (“right to be forgotten”)”.

**6. Right to transfer data**

You have the right to receive any personal data you have provided to us in a structured, current and machine-readable format. For this purpose you can contact datasecurity@toladata.com.

You also have the right to transfer this data to another controller without hindrance by the controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on a consent or on a contract to which the data subject is a party and that the processing is carried out by means of automated procedures.

When exercising your right to data transferability, you have the right to obtain the personal data to be transmitted directly by one person in charge to another person in charge, as far as this is technically feasible.

This right shall not apply where the rights and freedoms of other persons are adversely affected or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority delegated to the person responsible.

**7. Right to lodge a complaint**

Each user has a right to lodge a complaint vis-á-vis a supervisory authority of his/her choice. The supervisory authorities in Germany are the competent (data protection) authorities in accordance with the respective laws of the federal states (_Bundesländer_).

An overview of the European National Data Protection Authorities may be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080

**8. Duration of the storage of personal data; deletion periods**

As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum.

In the case of long-term contractual relationships, such as the use of our Offer, these storage periods may vary, but are generally limited to the duration of the contractual relationship or, with regard to the inventory data, to the maximum legal retention periods (e.g. in accordance with the German Commercial Code (_Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB_) and the Tax Code (_Abgabenordnung, AO_)).

Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still up-to-date, whether the contractual relationship with us still exists, whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the personal data concerned are relevant or not.
