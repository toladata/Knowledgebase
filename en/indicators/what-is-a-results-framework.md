# What is a Results Framework?
---
A **results framework**, sometimes called a Results Chain as well, is an explicit articulation \(graphic display, matrix, or summary\) of the different levels, or chains, of results expected from a particular intervention — a project, program, or development strategy.

The results specified typically comprise of long-term objectives (often referred to as “outcomes” or “impact”) and the intermediate outcomes and outputs that precede, and lead to, those desired long-term objectives.

The process of building a Results Framework starts with defining the overall program goal and then going down to Outcomes, Outputs and eventually Activities. From here, **program teams can use the Results Framework to define indicators to help them measure their results and align program activities to show how they contribute to achieving objectives**.

Some of the benefits of using a results framework:

* It helps focus on specific outcomes;

* It highlights the key linkages in the theory of change that underpin the intervention; 

* It helps establish an evidence-based approach to monitoring and evaluation;

* It helps measure progress toward strategic objectives;

* It helps achieve strategic objectives.
