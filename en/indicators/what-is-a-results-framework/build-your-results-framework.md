# Build your Results Framework 
---

After you've worked on and developed a Results Framework for your program, you're ready to add it to the system. See below how to do it.
1. Define the overall program goal. Add its level name and a description statement;

2. Create branches from the overall program goal and define the next set of level names (for example: Intermediate resut, Outcome, Output, Activity) and their description statements;

3. Continue this process until all your levels are defined and your program results are clearly outlined.

> **Quick Tip:**
> In order to add another Objective on the same level as the one you already have, use the `+` button above the existing box.
