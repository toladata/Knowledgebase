# Add Collected Data
---

There are a few possible ways to collect data against indicators on TolaData.

### Add indicator results manually

Go the the Indicators tab and select the `Collected Data` button next to your chosen indicator. Then enter your collected value and date manually. You can also select a corresponding periodic target. When you're done, hit `Submit`.

### Link any kind of evidence from Google Drive 

Any kind of document stored on Google Drive can be linked to your indicator results. Select Google Drive button and choose the corresponding file from your Drive. Choose any file type, be it Google Spreadsheet or a PDF file with a contract or partner agreement. You will have to authorize TolaData to use your Google Drive the first time you do it.

### Link tabular data evidence from Track

Indicator results can now be automated through Track without the need for manual updates! No need to spend hours collating indicator data from various sources for donor reporting.

Then select data points or columns from your evidence data table to perform calculations like summation/average etc. to automatically populate your indicator results field. Hit `Save result as evidence`.

You will see your result as 'Collected values'. Then, the only thing you need to do is to select the date when your data was collected and, after you hit `Submit`, you'll see it added to the overall indicator result. This result gets automatically updated each time new data is pulled into Track!

#### Add Disaggregation Data

Once you've pulled data in from Track you're able to further break your indicator result into previously specified groups. Select `Add Disaggregation Data` button, pick the disaggregation you want to add data for and type in your result. Then hit `Submit`.
