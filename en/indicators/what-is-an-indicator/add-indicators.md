<!--Indicator tracking helps explain how to define success and provides the ability to measure the performance of programs and projects.

* Value of Tracking Indicators

* Measure progress of programs and projects

* Tracking Indicators in Activiity provides access to all team members

* Provides ability to perform adaptive management

* Report against your agency's standard indicators

* Users can input all of their indicators and their entire indicator plan, as their primary system of record for all changes to indicators

* Standard and Custom Indicators

Within Activity we can provide a dropdown list of standard agency and governmental indicators, allowing users to select from those lists or users can choose to create a custom indicator.
--> 
Add your indicators under one of the previously created Results Framework levels, or leave them unassigned. You can always change that later.

1. To add an indicator, click an orange `+` button and fill out the fields. Mind that only your indicator name and LOP (Life of program) Target are required fields.
2. To save your indicator, hit `Submit`.

### Add Disaggregations
You can easily add disaggregations for each of your indicators if you need to analyze your beneficiary population in further detail. How many individuals are female or male? Which age or salary group they belong to? Add it in here.

### Add Periodic Targets
Besides the LOP Target, you can add periodic targets. Ongoing monitoring of your indicator results will help you catch potential hazards to achieving your goals and implement relevant remedies before it's too late. Also, some donors might require periodic reporting besides the end of program reports.

#### Standard reporting periods

To keep your reporting periods standard and consistent, add them at program level under the `Reporting Periods` tab and use for all indicators across your program.
