# Add Indicators
---

Add your indicators under one of the previously created Results Framework levels, or leave them unassigned. You can always change that later. 

1. To add an indicator, click an orange `+` button and fill out the fields. Mind that only your indicator name and LOP (Life of program) Target are required fields.
2. To save your indicator, hit `Submit`.

#### Numeric and percentage indicators

In TolaData you can track two types of indicators: **numeric ** and **percentage**. 

Use **numeric** for indicators like 'number of beneficiaries trained', 'average income' etc.

Calculate results for numeric indicators as average, sum or count of collected data.

Use **percentage** for indicators like 'percentage of beneficiaries trained', 'percentage of beneficiaries who passed the exam' etc.

Calculate your percentage indicator result as an average of all collected data or pick `User defined` as your actuals formula and select your result dataset manually.

### Add Disaggregations
You can easily add disaggregations for each of your indicators if you need to analyze your beneficiary population in further detail. How many individuals are female or male? Which age or salary group they belong to? Add it in here.

### Add Periodic Targets
Besides the LOP Target, you can add periodic targets. Ongoing monitoring of your indicator results will help you catch potential hazards to achieving your goals and implement relevant remedies before it's too late. Also, some donors might require periodic reporting besides the end of program reports.

#### Standard reporting periods

To keep your reporting periods standard and consistent, add them at program level under the `Reporting Periods` tab and use for all indicators across your program.
