# What is an Indicator?
---
An **indicator** is a quantitative measure or qualitative observation used to describe change. 

Indicators are linked to the objectives set in a Program Logframe to help measure the success and achievement of the said objectives. They are usually linked to different Results Framework levels. Indicators depict the extent to which a project is accomplishing its planned inputs, outputs, outcomes and goals.

For an indicator to measure change it must have:

* Baseline: a measure used to benchmark the current state of an indicator so that the recorded results can be appropriately calculated; 
* Target: the improvement or achievement expected to take place while the project is being implemented.

### Creating SMART indicators

When developing indicators, the norm is to use SMART criteria to guide performance indicator conceptualization. SMART is:

| Criterion | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **S**pecific | Describe your indicator precisely. What does the project intend to change? |
| **M**easurable | The indicator must be quantifiable and measurable. Can the indicator be assessed objectively and independently? |
| **A**chievable | Indicators must be attainable within the constraints of the project triangle \(budget/resources, time/budget, and scope/quality\). |
| **R**elevant | Indicators must accurately measure the change the project aspires to generate. Does the indicator practical and cost-effectively measure what the project team needs to know? |
| **T**ime-bound | The indicator should identify a specific time and date. By when will the indicator be achieved? Can the indicator be achieved within the established timeframe? |

### Basic Indicator Plan Format

Use this basic template to help you plan indicators for your program.

| Indicator name | Definition | Data collection sources and methods | Frequency of data collection | Person\(s\) responsible | Method of analysis | Information use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   | WHAT will be monitored | HOW it will be monitored | WHEN it will be monitored | WHO will monitor | HOW it will be analyzed | WHY it is monitored |
