# Approvals 
---

#### Adding Approvals

1. To add a module, click an orange `+` button and select `Approval`. 
2. To add a new approval, click `Add New`.

#### Use case 
Approvals saved in the system will guide you to supervisors, who need to sign off your work before you can move forward with your project work, be it a completed task or a new purchase that needs to be made.

> **Quick Tip:** 
Not all approvals have to be financial based. For example, a user from the Monitoring and Evaluation \(M&E\) team may be asked to approve an Indicator before data is collected whereas a Program Manager may be requested to approve the Activity before it is initiated.
