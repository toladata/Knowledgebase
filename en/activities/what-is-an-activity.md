# What is an Activity? 
---
Activities are concrete actions that you take to develop your program, in order to achieve your goals. Your 'Work breakdown structure (WBS)' or 'Detailed implementation plan' are composed of activities. 

<!-- This section is focused on capturing all the activities to be completed under your program. This is similar to your program workplan sometimes referred to as the 'Work breakdown structure \(WBS\)' or 'Detailed implementation plan'.
Here's a quick revision of where activities fall on TolaData data structure:

A great place for you to start will be looking at your program workplan to breakdown your program projects and activities. Here's an example:

> **Quick Tip:**   
> TolaData allows for flexibility in naming your workflow levels. As an Admin you may call them according to the naming convention adopted by your organization. In our example workflow level 2 is called 'Activities', but you can easily change it. See how in [this article on the Knowledge base](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/configuration.html).

### Adding new activities

Adding activities to a program is easy. Simply click on the orange `+` button to add new activities to your program. You can also add your tasks by clicking on `Add Task` and directly typing in the taks name.

See how to further edit the details of your activity in the next article on [Activity Modules on the Knowledge base](https://help.toladata.com/en/activities/activity-modules.html).

###  Manage your activities and tasks
When you are project planning, there are cases when you need to break down your activities into more manageable tasks. 

Tasks are simply created by dragging and dropping an Activity under another. This creates a Task that is still related to the Activity.

Here's how to do it:

1. Hover over an Activity.
2. Select an Activity and drag it from left to right under another Activity.
3. Release it and the project is now a Task.

> **Quick Tip:**   
> Tasks are lower level, smaller chunks of work that your activities are composed of. In TolaData they make workflow level 3. Read more on workflow levels in this [article on the Knowledge base](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/configuration.html).
