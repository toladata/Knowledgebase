# What is a Dashboard?
---
Dashboard is a custom report you can create yourself to get a quick understanding of the current status of selected aspects of your Program, Project/Activity, Indicator or other data point. Keep it to yourself or share across the organization (make it `Public in the organization` while creating a new dashboard or editing it). Dashboards are fully customizable, meaning you can create and adjust them to fit your current needs.  

Go to `Dashboards` tab on the navigation bar. You will see a list of tasks that are assigned to you as well as a selection of your most important widgets. 

> **Quick Tip:** A dashboard is a collection of widgets that describe selected phenomena of your choice.

### Create a dashboard
Click on `Add Dashboard` to add a new collection of widgets. Don't forget to hit `Submit` when you're done.

#### Add widgets
Keep on adding widgets to meet your current requirements. You can visualize data on Program or Project/Activity level, or add widgets on Sector, Indicators, Sites and even plain text! Images can be pasted into text fields, too.

### Sharing 
You can choose to keep it private, share with specific TolaData users or even across the organization.

#### Within the organization
Use the `Edit` button to make your dashboard accessible to anyone in your organization.

Select chosen users to share your dashboard with them directly.

#### Externally 
Eventually, you're just a screenshot away from a nice summary of your activities that you can share with anyone!
