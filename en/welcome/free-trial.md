Follow these easy steps to register for one month free trial and try out TolaData! TolaData is all about collaboration, so in this test period you can invite unlimited number of users to join your organization. How cool is that?

#### Create an organization and register an Org admin
Go to https://www.toladata.com/ to register your Org Admin account. Fill out a short questionnaire and you're good to go!

> **Quick Tip:** 
> Only the first person from your organization should register that way. This person will automatically get **Org admin** status [[read more on user permissions in this article](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/users.html)] and will be able to invite others to the platform later on.

#### Create an Org admin account
When you fill out the form on the website you'll be automatically taken to create your TolaData account. Simply add your details and that's it!

#### Invite users to TolaData
When you're already in, you can invite others to TolaData and configure the platform [[read more on configuration here](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/configuration.html)]. You will access your Admin Console by clicking on the round icon with your initials in the top right corner of screen.

Invitees will receive emails prompting them to create user accounts on TolaData. When they do, you will see them listed under `Users` tab and will be able to assign them to programs or change their user permissions.
