> **Quick Tip:** 
> Only the first person from your organization should register that way. This person will automatically get **Org admin** status [[read more on user permissions in this article](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/users.html)] and will be able to invite others to the platform later on.

#### Create an Org admin account
When you fill out the form on the website you'll be automatically taken to create your TolaData account. Simply add your details and that's it!
