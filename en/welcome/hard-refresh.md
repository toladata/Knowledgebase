# Hard refresh
---
**Tip:** 
> When it feels like your TolaData is hanging or you're not able to do what you want on the platform (like adding a new activity or a form), your browser might need a **hard refresh**. Read on to see how to do it. 

An internet browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox or IE) is how you access TolaData and many other services. Browsers **cache** [[read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache)] a lot of information like javascript or CSS to increase website performance and reduce lag. It means that this information is stored locally on your computer. 

However, with a living and changing application like ours (yes, we're working to make your experience as good as possible and often make small improvements on the website!) sometimes this can be a slight obstacle. Your browser 'remembers' the old version and prevents the new one from loading, causing you trouble. 

### How to do a hard refresh?

Hard refresh will erase what your browser remembers about the old version of the app, making space for the new one and allowing you to do what you want to do on TolaData.

**Tip:** 
> Don't worry about data you've added to TolaData, like indicators, sites or budget information. A hard refresh **will not have any affect on them**.
