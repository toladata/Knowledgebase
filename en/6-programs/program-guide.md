### Have a Portfolio or Country of Programs?
To create a country or portfolio level please contact us directly at: [support@toladata.com](mailto:support@toladata.com) for us to setup your own portfolio or country instance.

A **Program** is defined as a group of related projects and or activities managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available through managing them individually. 
> **Quick Tip:**   
> TolaData allows for flexibility in naming your workflow levels. As an Admin you may call them according to the naming convention adopted by your organization. In our example workflow level 1 is called 'Programs', but you can easily change it. See how in [this article on the Knowledge base](https://help.toladata.com/en/4-manage-users/configuration.html).

Most program details can be found in program proposals and concept notes developed in your program's proposal development and setup and planning phases. 

Here's an example of how Programs, Projects and Activities can be broken down:

2. Come back to the Program Guide by simply clicking on the three dots icon, accessible from the Programs tab in every program's row.
