### Add User to a Program

Once they've signed up, select the program you want to add them to and go the Team section. Once there, click on `Add Existing Team Member` to add relevant team member from the drop-down menu.

> **Quick Tip:**
> You will add users to programs from a selected program's `Team` tab, not from the `Admin console`.
