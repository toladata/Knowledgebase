### Login to TolaData

With the [**TolaData login**](https://activity.toladata.io) users can sign up to access the TolaData platform.

There are a few ways a user can sign on:
**Single Sign-on \(SSO\) options:**

* Google
* Office 365

**Register a Tola Account**

1. If you prefer not to use single sign-on via Office 365, we have the option for users to register a TolaData account by going to: [https://api.toladata.io/accounts/register/](https://api.toladata.io/accounts/register/)
2. Fill out the registration form and under the `Org` field, enter the name of the organization that your user should be associated with and we'll ping the Org Administrator about it.

### Add User to a Program

Once they've signed up, select the program you want to add them to and go the Team section. Once there, click on `Add Existing Team Member` to add relevant team member from the drop-down menu.
> **Quick Tip:**
> You will add users to programs from a selected program's `Team` tab, not from the `Admin console`.

### Configuring Team

#### Set or Change Team Roles

It's easy to assign different permission levels to each member of your team. You must be designated as a Program Admin in order to set or change Team Member roles.

1. Go to the `Programs` tab and click on the `Team` section.
2. Click `Add Existing Team Member` to select the User you want to add to your team.

Once added, you can change the role of a team member:

1. Under Role, click on the drop-down menu and select a user role: Program Admin, Program Team, View Only.

#### Permission levels in TolaData

There are three types of user roles in the system:

* Program Admin
* Program Team
* View Only

> **Quick Tip:**
> Additionally there is also an Organization Admin. This role has Program Admin access to all programs, as well as the right to configure system settings for their organization. See more in [this article about Configuration](https://help.toladata.com/en/admin-console/configuration.html).
