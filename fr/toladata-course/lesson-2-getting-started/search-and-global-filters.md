#### Practice

Go to TolaData and **search for something**. Try typing in 'Syria' \(you'll see why in the next Lesson\), or something related to your program or project if you're on your production site. Then, try to apply a global filter.

**\*You can report on any issues using the question mark "?" button at the bottom left corner of the navigation bar in the system.**
