# Four easy steps to delivering a training
---

Now that you are all set to use TolaData, you can teach your team how to use it! Find below a generic set of trainer's tasks that you can pick and choose from, to fit your needs.

### 1. Assess what is there to be done

The following factors are worth considering while preparing for the training:

1. Who are your learners? Understand their strengths, weaknesses and needs. For TolaData training, we're using the following [user assessment form](https://enketo.ona.io/x/#IyJ4HdHD) [redirects to an external website]. Find a corresponding XLS form in the Resources section below.
2. Why do you want them to learn a new skill? No one engages eagerly in activities they deem pointless and you don't want to loose their or your time, either. 
3. What do they need to learn? Precisely define the scope of your training based on goals and needs. Customization is the key - teach only what people need to know for their job function and role. You might want to split the group based on that.
4. What is the expected benefit to both your learners and the organization? Anticipate resistance and act: be prepared to speak to how TolaData benefits to [funders](https://www.toladata.com/dashboard-for-funders/), [project managers](https://www.toladata.com/project-managers-ngo/) and [senior managers](https://www.toladata.com/senior-managers-ngos/) [redirects to TolaData website].
5. What resources do you need to deliver the training? Think about the logistics: format (online, in person), time, room (projector, sitting arrangement), internet connection, possibly travel and accommodation.

### 2. Prepare the training

##### Planning
Look up examples of TolaData [training agendas that we prepared for different training formats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GJvaVOyblWtPHQ7ibz0IcuOCIhEMKgx1533Dv05o1Q4/edit?usp=sharing) (self paced, online facilitated and in person trainings) as well as training [slidedeck you can use to provide training on all TolaData components](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yd7mzJvzj1kaI5EA3pAzTPlv3agc3gsP) [redirects to an external website]. Remember: everyone wants to see the system, so start with demoing TolaData to your team as early as possible in the training.

##### Engagement
You will want your training to be both an efficient and pleasant event. For in person training, don't forget to use energizers. [We've put together a selection of tested ones for you](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HohufUBEUc8vqR-C93TL8-36AKNOlFI2QuX3i9XYoms/edit?usp=sharing) [redirects to an external website]. In online facilitated classes check in with your participants often, to make sure they're focused and on track. You might also want to use engagement tools, like surveys, voting or raising hands that are provided by most online conference tools.

##### Feedback
Don't forget to ask your trainees for opinion! Consult [TolaData evaluation](https://enketo.ona.io/x/#L3629Jgu) form and play around with its XLS form in the Resources section. For in person trainings, you might want to consider having feedback sessions (sharing opinion verbally or in writing, see picture) at the end of the training to identify possible pitfalls and areas to improve.

### 3. Conduct the training

What could possibly go wrong? Well, be prepared for the unexpected and to change the agenda according to the participants' needs. In both in person and online classes you might want to make sure there is a co-trainer by your side, to help you attend to individual questions or to support trainees who are lagging behind. 

### 4. Support the team while they use TolaData

Think of a convenient way to address your trainees' requests and anything else that come up after the training. Do you want to set up a group on some messanger, or use your intranet for it? It's up to you, but your trainees need to know where to go when in trouble. 

##### Invite team members to TolaData

You might conduct the training on the [demo site](https://demo.toladata.io/) [redirects to an external website], but eventually you want everyone to use your production site. Send all your team members invitation to TolaData! Ask them to login to. Then add them to your program team.
