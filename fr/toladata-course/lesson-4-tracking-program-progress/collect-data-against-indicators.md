#### Practice

Go to TolaData and **add evidence to your indicator**. Please mind that in order to be able to do that, you will have to have created a program with at least one indicator beforehand. 

##### Sample datasets

Feel free to use sample data:
1. Download a PDF with a [WHO sample agreement with an NGO](http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/tools/manuals/who_field_handbook/c8.pdf?ua=1) \[redirects to an external website\];
2. Download a sample Beneficiaries list as a CSV file or link it to TolaData directly [from GoogleDrive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18kZeA9f9akq1PYCNVErtiaMqKzvIity3ZwbTchTptXc/edit?usp=sharing) \[redirects to an external website\].
